# The Algorithms in C

These algorithms are the demonstration purposes only. There are
many algorithms implementations in the C standard
library that are much better for performance reasons. This
project contains the following algorithms...

## Allocators

| Name allocator                           | Allocation | Free |
|:----------------------------------------:|:----------:|:----:|
| Linear allocator                         | O(1)       | -    |
| Pool allocator                           | O(1)       | O(1) |

Other algorithms will be added later. Please follow the news.
